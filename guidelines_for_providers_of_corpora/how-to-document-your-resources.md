### How to document your resources {#how-to-document-your-resources}

To be fully compliant with OpenMinTeD, you must

*   ensure that the corpus is distributed under Open Access conditions
*   include in the metadata record a link to the licence document that describes the terms and conditions under which it is provided, and attach the licence document together with the resource
*   if you already have a PID for your publication (preferably DOI), make sure it is included in the metadata record.

****Further recommendations will contribute to the interoperability of your resources:****

*   Further adoption of standards such as the [JATS article tag suite](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/index.html) or [TEI P5 guidelines](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/) for annotating the inner structure of texts is recommended.
*   Please, ensure that you version all your resources and label the versions in an unambiguous way, preferably following the [Semantic Versioning recommendations](http://semver.org/).
*   It is important that you provide the appropriate documentation for your resource (e.g. publications about the design and construction of the corpus etc.), which you should also version along with the corpus and add as reference to your metadata record.
*   Recommend one of the publications about your resource as the one to be cited for scholarly attribution and add this information in the metadata record.
*   Make sure that you fill in the metadata record all the elements required for citing your resource[^1], i.e. the creator of the resource, a title, the resource type and an identifier, and optionally, the publication date, the version and the publisher or distributor of
*   Use standard classification vocabularies (e.g. [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/), [DDC](https://www.oclc.org/dewey.en.html), [LCSH](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) etc.) for adding classification tags to your material and specify the vocabulary you use in the metadata record; give at least one broad category for your material (e.g. life sciences, computing etc.).
*   In all cases, where linking to other resources or entities (e.g. persons, projects etc.) in the metadata records is added, please try to do this through unique and persistent identifiers of authority lists and sources, to the extent possible, documenting also the authority and/or scheme it adheres to.
