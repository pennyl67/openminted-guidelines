# Guidelines for providers of corpora {#guidelines-for-providers-of-corpora}

OpenMinTeD facilitates the use of TDM technologies in the scientific publications world, ranging from generic scholarly communication to literature related to specific disciplines.

Corpora in the OpenMinTeD framework refer mainly to the _**collections of publications that will be used as mining source**_ in the TDM process. In fact, the OpenMinTeD platform includes a mechanism for automatically generating corpora based on user criteria selected from a faceted view of all publications provided by the OpenMinTeD partners - more details are included in the [Building corpora of scholarly content offered in OpenMinTeD](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md).

Corpora may also be imported \(upon bilateral agreements\) from repositories of language resources, such as [META-SHARE](http://www.meta-share.eu) and [CLARIN](http://www.clarin.eu), or discipline-specific repositories, or uploaded by users for processing with TDM tools/services at their own personal workspace.

Corpora uploaded in OpenMinTeD in this way will not necessarily be composed of scholarly works. Examples include reference corpora \(i.e. corpora deemed representative of general language or a sublanguage usage\), news corpora, collections of domain-specific texts, such as manuals, etc. as well as annotated corpora, such as treebanks, morphologically tagged golden corpora etc. These corpora can be mined by TDM applications only if they are compatible with the OpenMinTeD specifications. Otherwise, they can be used \(upon availability of the respective components/applications\) for other objectives, such as training Machine Learning models, evaluating the performance of applications, etc.
