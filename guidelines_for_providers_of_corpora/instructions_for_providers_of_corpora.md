### How to share corpora {#How-to-share-your-resources}

At present, corpora can be added only by **authorised users** at the [OpenMinTeD registry](https://services.openminted.eu/resourceRegistration/corpus/upload).

If you wish to add a corpus, you must provide:

* a zipped file with the contents of the corpus; where possible, the zipped file should follow the folder structure recommended for OpenMinTeD publications, i.e. separate folders for full text contents \(entitled "fulltext"\), metadata records \(entitled "metadata"\)[^1] and licence documents \(entitled "licence"\); if available, you can also use an additional folder entitled "abstract" for delivering abstracts;

* a metadata record compliant with the [OMTD-SHARE schema for corpora, at least at the minimal level](/guidelines_for_providers_of_corpora/recommended_schema_for_corpora.md) which you can upload to the Registry as an XML file and/or edit with the OpenMinTeD metadata editor.

If the corpus is stored at the repository of a network or infrastructure that allows harvesting \(normally upon agreements made with OpenMinTeD\), you can also provide the relevant identifier and this will be uploaded with the appropriate description[^2]. Where possible \(and this will be appropriately indicated\), the metadata description will be automatically converted to the OMTD-SHARE schema and presented to the end-user for further editing.

[^1]: The metadata records for single documents should normally be compliant with at least the [minimal OMTD-SHARE schema for publications](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/recommended_schema_for_publications.md); however, given that content delivered in the form of corpora is not integrated in the [OpenMinTeD mechanism for building corpora](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md), these metadata are not used in any way and are therefore optional at this point. 
[^2]: This option will be made available at a later stage.
