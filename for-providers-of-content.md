#Guidelines for providers of content {#guidelines-for-providers-of-publications}

We welcome **content resources that can be mined** with the TDM applications that OpenMinTeD hosts.
Content is added in the [OpenMinTeD platform](https://services.openminted.eu/) through different procedures in the form of
* **[single documents](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/README.md)**, or 
* **[corpora](/guidelines_for_providers_of_corpora/README.md)**, i.e. collections of documents.

##Deployment of content in OpenMinTeD
End-users of the OpenMinTeD platform are interested in the **processed output**, the information that is mined out of the documents rather than reading the documents one by one. Thus, **content resources are accessed only in the form of corpora**.
For the single documents added in the registry, OpenMinTeD includes a mechanism for **automatically generating corpora based on user criteria** selected from a faceted view - more details are included [here](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md).

##Focus on scholarly content
OpenMinTeD focuses on the use of TDM technologies in the **scientific literature** world, ranging from generic scholarly communication to publications related to specific disciplines.
