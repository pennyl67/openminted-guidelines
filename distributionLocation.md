Please, ensure that the link leads preferrably to the actual content of the corpus and not to a landing page.

* For corpora that are available in various formats \(e.g. PDF, TXT, XML etc.\) please repeat combining together the dataFormat, the distributionMedium and the distributionURL.
* For corpora created through the OMTD corpus building process, the full content is already uploaded in OpenMinTeD, and therefore the downloadURL is automatically inserted \(public url link from which the corpus can be downloaded\).
* For ontologies, you can add the URL where they can be downloaded from \(with distributionMedium=downloadable\) or the SPARQL query endpoint \(with distributionMedium=webExecutable\)
