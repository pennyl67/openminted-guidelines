##### Recommended usage

The recommended way for referring to a journal is by giving their identifier \(e.g. ISSN, DOI\); if you provide the identifier, please select also the relevant value from the list of values in the attribute "journalIdentifierSchemeName"; if none is appropriate, please select "other" and use the "schemeURI" attribute to provide a link to a URL with more information about the identifier scheme.   
If you don't know the identifier of the journal, you may provide the title at least in English; if you want to add titles in other languages, you can use the “lang” attribute.
