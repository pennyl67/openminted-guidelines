# OpenMinTeD guidelines

Welcome to the OpenMinTeD Guidelines!

This is where you'll find information on the following:

* how to make your resources compatible with [OpenMinTeD Interoperability Specifications](https://openminted.github.io/releases/interop-spec/)
* how to add your resources in the [OpenMinTeD platform](https:\\services.openminted.eu)[^1]
* [how to give us feedback for the guidelines](/contributing-to-the-guidelines.md).

## Structure of the guidelines
Three guidelines are released addressing **providers of the [resources that OpenMinTeD targets](/about-openminted.md)**:

* [Guidelines for providers of content (scholarly and scientific publications & corpora)](/for-providers-of-content.md)

* [Guidelines for providers of ancillary knowledge resources](/guidelines_for_providers_of_ancillary_resources/README.md)

Each set of guidelines contains the following information:
* a brief introduction, specifying the resources expected, potential sources, minimal requirements for the contributions
* preparing, packaging and registering instructions for the OpenMinTeD platform
* technical and metadata requirements that empower interoperability
* for each resource type, an overview of the minimal level of the [OMTD-SHARE metadata schema](/the_omtd-share_metadata_schema.md) with definitions, explanations, recommended usage and mappings to other popular  metadata schemas
* further instructions per type of contributors or resource type/subtype where required.
