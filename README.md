# OpenMinTeD guidelines

Welcome to the OpenMinTeD Guidelines!

This is where you'll find information on the following:

* how to make your resources interoperable with other resources for Text and Data Mining (TDM) purposes
* how to share your resources through the [OpenMinTeD platform](https:\\services.openminted.eu)
[^1]
* how to build new TDM applications with existing components
* [how to give us feedback and contribute to the guidelines](/contributing-to-the-guidelines.md).


### What is OpenMinTeD?
OpenMinTeD enables the creation of an infrastructure that fosters and facilitates the use of **Text and Data Mining (TDM) technologies **in the world of **scholarly content**, builds on existing TDM tools and platforms, and renders them discoverable and interoperable through a dedicated registry and a standards-based interoperability layer.

In an ecosystem of e-infrastructures and repositories, the OpenMinTeD platform has been designed and implemented as a **facilitator** of TDM, collecting from other sources, transforming and making available **only resources needed for running TDM operations**.

Resources are registered in OpenMinTeD **only if they can be accessed and deployed in the context of a TDM processing operation**.

The OpenMinTeD platform is neither a repository for the curation and long-term preservation of content and services, nor a catalogue of information about resources that might be of interest to TDM stakeholders.



### What types of resources does OpenMinTeD target?
TDM involves a wide range of resource types:

* the _content resources to be mined_, i.e. _scholarly publications_ in the current phase,
* the _TDM software_ and
* _ancillary knowledge resources_ used for the operation of the software \(e.g. machine learning models, lexical or ontological resources used for annotating the resources to be mined, typesystems, annotation schemas, linguistic tagsets, annotated textual corpora used for training and evaluation\).

### Structure of the guidelines
Four guidelines are released addressing providers of the target resources:

* [Guidelines for providers of scholarly content](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/README.md)
* [Guidelines for providers of corpora](/guidelines_for_providers_of_corpora/README.md)
* [Guidelines for providers of software resources](/guidelines_for_providers_of_sw_resources/README.md)
* [Guidelines for providers of ancillary knowledge resources](/guidelines_for_providers_of_ancillary_resources/README.md)

Each set of guidelines contains the following information:
* a brief introduction, specifying the resources expected, potential sources, minimal requirements for the contributions
* preparing, packaging and registering instructions for the OpenMinTeD platform
* technical and metadata requirements that empower interoperability
* for each resource type, an overview of the [OMTD-SHARE metadata schema](/the_omtd-share_metadata_schema.md) \(minimal level\) with definitions, explanations, recommended usage and mappings to other popular  metadata schemas
* further instructions per type of contributors or resource type/subtype where required.
