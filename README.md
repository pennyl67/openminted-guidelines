# OpenMinTeD guidelines {#openminted-guidelines}

Welcome to the OpenMinTeD Guidelines!

OpenMinTeD aspires to enable the creation of an infrastructure that fosters and facilitates the use of text mining technologies in the scientific publications world, builds on existing text mining tools and platforms, and renders them discoverable and interoperable through appropriate registries and a standards-based interoperability layer, respectively.

This is where you'll find information on

* how to make your resources interoperable with other resources for TDM purposes
* how to share your resources in the OpenMinTeD platform \(link to be provided soon\)
* how to contribute to the guidelines.

TDM involves a wide range of resource types:

* the _content resources to be mined_, i.e. _scholarly publications_ in the current phase,
* the _text mining software_ and
* _ancillary knowledge resources_ used for the operation of the software \(e.g. annotation schemas, linguistic tagsets, lexical or ontological resources used for annotating the resources to be mined, machine learning models, annotated textual corpora\).

Four guidelines are released targeting providers of these resources:

* [Guidelines for providers of publications](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/README.md)
* [Guidelines for providers of corpora](/guidelines_for_providers_of_corpora/README.md)
* [Guidelines for providers of software resources](/guidelines_for_providers_of_sw_resources/README.md)
* [Guidelines for providers of knowledge resources](/guidelines_for_providers_of_knowledge_resources/README.md)

The OpenMinTeD platform serves as a **facilitator** of TDM in an ecosystem of e-infrastructures and repositories, collecting, transforming and making available **resources only as needed for TDM purposes**. In other words, it is not one more registry of content and services, and it doesn't seek to collect and provide information about resources that might be of interest to TDM stakeholders.

{% blurb style='tip', title='Important notice' %}
Resources are to be registered into OpenMinTeD only if they can be accessed and deployed in the context of a TDM processing operation.
{% endblurb %}

Each set of guidelines contains the following information:

* a brief introduction, specifying the resources expected, potential sources, minimal requirements for the contributions
* packaging and uploading instructions for the OpenMinTeD registry
* technical and metadata requirements that empower interoperability
* for each resource type, an overview of the OMTD-SHARE metadata schema \(minimal level\) with definitions, explanations, recommended usage and mappings to other popular and supported by OpenMinTeD metadata schemas
* further instructions per type of contributors or resource type\/subtype where required.
