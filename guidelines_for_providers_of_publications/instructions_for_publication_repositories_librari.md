### How to share content through aggregators {#instructions-for-publication-repositories-libraries-journals-publishers-etc}

If you are a publisher, literature repository, archive etc., and wish to register scholarly publications that can be harvested for TDM purposes through the [OpenMinTeD platform](https://services.openminted.eu), you can do so

* by registering through [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu), following procedures and guidelines at: [https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action](https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action)

OR

* by registering through [CORE](http://core.ac.uk), following procedures at: [https://core.ac.uk/join](https://core.ac.uk/join)

###Minimum requirements for single documents (publications)
For each publication, you must 
* ensure that you adhere to the minimal level of the [OpenMinTed Interoperability specifications](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/recommendations-for-publishers.md), 
* provide access to a file with the **full text** 
* deliver a **metadata description** with a minimal set of metadata elements in compliance with the [**OMTD-SHARE schema**](/the_omtd-share_metadata_schema.md) for publications and in XML format; the metadata elements are used for creating uniform facets for querying the entire set of publications uploaded in OpenMinTeD \(see [here](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md) for more information on the deployment of publications in OpenMinTeD\).
