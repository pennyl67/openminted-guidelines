## How to share content through aggregators {#instructions-for-publication-repositories-libraries-journals-publishers-etc}

If you are a publisher, literature repository, archive etc., and wish to register scholarly publications that can be harvested for TDM purposes through the [OpenMinTeD platform](https://services.openminted.eu), you can do so

* by registering through [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu), following procedures and guidelines at: [https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action](https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action)

OR

* by registering through [CORE](http://core.ac.uk), following procedures at: [https://core.ac.uk/join](https://core.ac.uk/join)

### Minimal requirements

For each publication, you must deliver:

* a file with the **full text** 
* a **metadata description** with at least bibliographic information about it, in preference following the OpenAIRE guidelines; these metadata elements are **mapped by the aggregators** into the [OMTD-SHARE metadata schema](/the_omtd-share_metadata_schema.md) and used for creating uniform facets that end-users deploy for acessing the entire set of publications imported in OpenMinTeD from different sources \(see [here](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md) for more information on the deployment of publications in OpenMinTeD\).

For further requirements and recommendations that publications must meet in order to be compatible with OpenMinTeD TDM tools and services, please see [here](/recommendations-for-publishers.md).
