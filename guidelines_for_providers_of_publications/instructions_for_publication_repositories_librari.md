## Uploading publications (instructions for repositories, journals, publishers) {#instructions-for-publication-repositories-libraries-journals-publishers-etc}

If you wish to register publications that can be harvested for TDM purposes through OpenMinTeD, you can do so

* by registering through [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu), following procedures and guidelines at: [https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action](https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action)

OR

* by registering through [CORE](http://core.ac.uk), following procedures at: [https://core.ac.uk/join](https://core.ac.uk/join)

### Minimal requirements
For each publication, you must deliver:
* a file with the **full text** 
* a **metadata description** with at least bibliographic information about it, in preference following the OpenAIRE guidelines; these metadata elements are mapped into the OMTD-SHARE metadata schema and used for creating uniform facets that end-users deploy for acessing the entire set of publications imported in OpenMinTeD from different sources (see [here](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md) for more information on the deployment of publications in OpenMinTeD).

For further requirements and recommendations that publications must meet in order to be compatible with OpenMinTeD TDM tools and services, please see [here](/recommendations-for-publishers.md).
