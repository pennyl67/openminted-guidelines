##Providers of single documents (publications)
Scholarly publications come from a wide bulk of stakeholders, e.g. institutional and discipline repositories, academic journals, scientific publishers, etc. For the first phase, the focus is on **literature repositories and publishers**, as regards sources, and on **Open Access content**, as regards access conditions.

If you are a **publisher or a repository of scholarly works **and wish to provide your resources in OpenMinTeD for TDM purposes, you can:

* deposit them through one of the aggregators that OpenMinTeD has already liaised with, following their respective guidelines and procedures - for more information, see [here](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/instructions_for_publication_repositories_librari.md),

{% blurb style='tip'%}
OpenMinTeD relies on existing infrastructures and standards/best practices for its operation. Thus, to access scholarly publications, it relies on the two main aggregators of such content, [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu) and [CORE](http://core.ac.uk).

* provide them directly into OpenMinTeD by implementing a content connector as described [here](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/instructions_for_aggregators.md).

###Minimum requirements for single documents (publications)
For each publication, you must 
* ensure that you adhere to the minimal level of the [OpenMinTeD Interoperability specifications](/recommendations-for-publishers.md), 
* provide access to a file with the **full text** 
* deliver a **metadata record** with the minimal set of elements required by the [**OMTD-SHARE schema**](/the_omtd-share_metadata_schema.md) for publications; the metadata elements are used for creating uniform facets for querying the entire set of publications uploaded in OpenMinTeD \(see [here](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md) for more information on the deployment of publications in OpenMinTeD\).
