#Guidelines for providers of content {#guidelines-for-providers-of-publications}

We welcome **content resources that can be mined** with the TDM applications that OpenMinTeD hosts.
Content is added in the [OpenMinTeD platform](https://services.openminted.eu/) through different procedures in the form of
* **single documents**, or 
* **corpora**, i.e. collections of documents.

##Deployment of content in OpenMinTeD
End-users of the OpenMinTeD platform are interested in the **processed output**, the information that is mined out of the documents rather than reading the documents one by one. Thus, **content resources are accessed only in the form of corpora**.
Therefore, for the single documents added in the registry, the OpenMinTeD platform includes a mechanism for automatically generating corpora based on user criteria selected from a faceted view - more details are included [here](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md).

##Focus on scholarly content
OpenMinTeD focuses on the use of TDM technologies in the **scientific literature** world, ranging from generic scholarly communication to publications related to specific disciplines.

##Providers of single documents (publications)
Scholarly publications come from a wide bulk of stakeholders, e.g. institutional and discipline repositories, academic journals, scientific publishers, etc. For the first phase, the focus is on **literature repositories and publishers**, as regards sources, and on **Open Access content**, as regards access conditions.

If you are a **publisher or a repository of scholarly works **and wish to provide your resources in OpenMinTeD for TDM purposes, you can:

* deposit them through one of the aggregators that OpenMinTeD has already liaised with, following their respective guidelines and procedures - for more information, see [here](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/instructions_for_publication_repositories_librari.md),

{% blurb style='tip'%}
OpenMinTeD relies on existing infrastructures and standards/best practices for its operation. Thus, to access scholarly publications, it relies on the two main aggregators of such content, [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu) and [CORE](http://core.ac.uk).
{% endblurb %}

* provide them directly into OpenMinTeD by implementing a content connector as described [here](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/instructions_for_aggregators.md).

###Minimum requirements for single documents (publications)
For each publication, you must deliver:
* a file with the **full text** 
* a **metadata description** with a minimal set of metadata elements in compliance with the [**OMTD-SHARE schema**](/the_omtd-share_metadata_schema.md) for publications and in XML format; the metadata elements are used for creating uniform facets for querying the entire set of publications uploaded in OpenMinTeD \(see [here](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md) for more information on the deployment of publications in OpenMinTeD\).


##Providers of corpora
Corpora may also be imported (upon bilateral agreements) from repositories of language resources, or discipline-specific repositories, or **uploaded by users** for processing with TDM applications.

If you wish to share corpora through OpenMinTeD, you will find more information [here](/guidelines_for_providers_of_corpora/instructions_for_providers_of_corpora.md).
