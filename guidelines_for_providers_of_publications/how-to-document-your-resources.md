### How to document your resources {#how-to-document-your-resources}

In the case of publications, the required metadata records come at two levels:

* one for the whole query-generated corpus of publications, in compliance with the OMTD-SHARE schema for corpora, which is automatically constructed on the basis of the user filters and manually enriched by the user;
* one per publication, with a minimal set of metadata elements in compliance with the OMTD-SHARE schema for publications, automatically converted from the current schemas of the providers. 

It should be noted that the original resource providers \(e.g. publication repositories, publishers etc.\) that offer publications via OpenAIRE and CORE do not have to change their current schemas; mappings and conversions between the OpenAIRE[^1] and CORE metadata and the OMTD-SHARE schema are made by the providers themselves in the framework of OpenMinTeD[^2].

All metadata records for publications must be delivered in XML format.

[^1] The OpenAIRE schema and guidelines are currently under revision; collaboration with the relevant actors has been established to take into account the new features and, where desired, influence the changes so as to support TDM processes in accordance to the interoperability requirements.
