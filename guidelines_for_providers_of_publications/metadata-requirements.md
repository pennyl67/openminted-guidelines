### How to document your resources {#documentation-metadata-requirements}

To be fully compatible with OpenMinTeD, you must

*   provide a metadata record for each publication with at least bibliographic information about it, in preference following the OpenAIRE or CORE guidelines
*   ensure that the publications are distributed under Open Access conditions
*   include in the metadata record of each publication a link to the licence document that describes the terms and conditions under which it is provided, and attach the licence document together with the publication
*   if you already have a PID for your publication (preferably DOI), make sure it is included in the metadata record.

The following recommendations will help interaction of your resources, but they are not mandatory.

*   Further adoption of standards such as the [JATS article tag suite](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/index.html) or [TEI P5 guidelines](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/) for annotating the inner structure of publications is recommended.
*   Use standard classification vocabularies, such as [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/), [DDC](https://www.oclc.org/dewey.en.html), [LCSH](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) etc.) for adding classification tags to your material and specify the vocabulary you use in the metadata record; give at least one broad category for your material (e.g. life sciences, computing etc.).
*   In all cases, where linking to other resources or entities (e.g. persons, projects etc.) in the metadata records is added, please try to do this through unique and persistent identifiers of authority lists and sources, to the extent possible, documenting also the authority and/or scheme it adheres to.
