## Sharing knowledge resources \(ML models, grammars and annotation resources\) {#instructions-for-providers-of-ancillary-knowledge-resources}

Ancillary knowledge resources for TDM \(annotation resources, ML models and grammars\) can be registered only by **authorised users** at the [OpenMinTeD registry](https://services.openminted.eu).

If you wish to register such a resource, you must provide
* direct access to the contents of the resource and
* describe it appropriately with a metadata record compliant with at least the [minimal OMTD-SHARE schema for knowledge resources](/recommended-metadata-for-knowledge-resources.md).

You can add a knowledge resource in one of the following two ways:
* upload the resource as a zipped file (preserving the original folder structure)
* add in the _[distributionLocation](/distributionLocation.md)_ element of the OMTD-SHARE record a hyperlink (e.g. URL or FTP point) from where the resource can be downloaded from.

As regards the metadata record, you can 
* use the OpenMinTeD editor to describe the resource at the minimal level or
* upload an XML file compatible with the OMTD-SHARE schema directly into the registry.
