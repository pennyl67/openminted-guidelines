## Sharing knowledge resources \(ML models, grammars and annotation resources\) {#instructions-for-providers-of-ancillary-knowledge-resources}

Ancillary knowledge resources for TDM \(ML models, grammars and annotation resources\) can be registered only by authorised users at the [OpenMinTeD registry](https://services.openminted.eu)[^1].

If you wish to register such a resource, you must provide
* direct access to the contents of the resource and
* describe it appropriately with a metadata record compliant with the [OMTD-SHARE schema](/guidelines_for_providers_of_ancillary_resources/recommended_schema_for_lexicalconceptual_resources.md).

You can register a knowledge resource in one of the following two ways:
* upload the resource as a zipped file (preserving the original folder structure)
* specify in the OMTD-SHARE metadata record a hyperlink (e.g. URL or FTP point) from where the resource can be downloaded from.

As regards the metadata record, you can 
* use the OpenMinTeD editor to describe the resource at the minimal level or
* upload an XML file compatible with the OMTD-SHARE schema directly into the registry.

[^1] The platform is still under development; the functionality for registering knowledge resources will soon be made available.
