# About OpenMinTeD

###  What is OpenMinTeD?
[OpenMinTeD](htttp://openminted.eu) enables the creation of an infrastructure that fosters and facilitates the use of **Text and Data Mining (TDM) technologies **in the world of **scholarly content**, builds on existing TDM tools and platforms, and renders them discoverable and interoperable through a dedicated registry and a standards-based interoperability layer.

###  What is the OpenMinTeD platform?
The [OpenMinTeD platform](https://services.openminted.eu) acts as a **facilitator** of TDM. 

It's the place where 
* researchers can 
 * search for TDM applications ready-to-use,
 * build corpora from the scholarly publications that OpenMinTeD offers or upload their own corpora, and
 * process these corpora with the TDM applications of their choice;
* TDM experts can 
 * add their software components or end-user applications,
 * add ancillary knowledge resources,
 * mix and match their components and ancillary knowledge resources though the OpenMinTeD workflow editor in order to create new end-user applications.

To implement this vision, OpenMinTeD takes advantage of the existing ecosystem of e-infrastructures and repositories. It thus relies on the addition by registered users of **resources only if they can be used for running TDM operations** It also collects from other trusted sources, transforms all resources to the desired format and makes them available to the end users.

Resources are added in OpenMinTeD **only if they can be accessed and deployed in the context of a TDM processing operation**.

The OpenMinTeD platform is neither a repository for the curation and long-term preservation of content and services, nor a catalog of information about resources that might be of interest to TDM stakeholders.


### What types of resources does OpenMinTeD target?
TDM involves a wide range of resource types:

* the _content resources to be mined_, i.e. _scholarly publications_ in the current phase,
* the _TDM software_ and
* _ancillary knowledge resources_ used for the operation of the software \(e.g. machine learning models, lexical or ontological resources used for annotating the resources to be mined, typesystems, annotation schemas, linguistic tagsets, annotated textual corpora used for training and evaluation\).
