# About OpenMinTeD

##  What is OpenMinTeD?
OpenMinTeD enables the creation of an infrastructure that fosters and facilitates the use of **Text and Data Mining (TDM) technologies **in the world of **scholarly content**, builds on existing TDM tools and platforms, and renders them discoverable and interoperable through a dedicated registry and a standards-based interoperability layer.

In an ecosystem of e-infrastructures and repositories, the OpenMinTeD platform has been designed and implemented as a **facilitator** of TDM, collecting from other sources, transforming and making available **only resources needed for running TDM operations**. 

{% blurb style='tip'%}
Resources are registered in OpenMinTeD **only if they can be accessed and deployed in the context of a TDM processing operation**.

The OpenMinTeD platform is neither a repository for the curation and long-term preservation of content and services, nor a catalogue of information about resources that might be of interest to TDM stakeholders.



## What types of resources does OpenMinTeD target?
TDM involves a wide range of resource types:

* the _content resources to be mined_, i.e. _scholarly publications_ in the current phase,
* the _TDM software_ and
* _ancillary knowledge resources_ used for the operation of the software \(e.g. machine learning models, lexical or ontological resources used for annotating the resources to be mined, typesystems, annotation schemas, linguistic tagsets, annotated textual corpora used for training and evaluation\).
