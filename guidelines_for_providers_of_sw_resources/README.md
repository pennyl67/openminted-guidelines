# â€‹Guidelines for providers of software \(applications and components\) {#guidelines-for-providers-of-s-w-resources}

We welcome 
* end-user **applications **that can be used as-is to perform TDM operations on content resources, as well as
* **components**, i.e. pieces of software that perform basic tasks; using the OpenMinTeD Workflow Editor, TDM developers can combine together components and tune them with ancillary knowledge resources in order to build applications that will be offered to end-users.
